                <p style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">By understanding the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance, anyone will get motivated to take the necessary steps for achieving this balance. Work-Life balance is advantageous for the employees and organization as well. A balance between the work and personal life, helps in improving the employee productivity, morale and health condition. In fact, work-life balance should be a priority for all of us. An imbalance in any of the front will make the life difficult and pose several hazards or challenges in terms of health, happiness and emotional stability.</p>

                <p style="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive;">Contrary to the widespread belief that overtime will result in the surge in productivity; but studies reveal that long working hours will lead to loss of efficiency or exhaustion and ultimately will reduce the overall productivity. Studies equally reveal that people who work by availing short breaks are comparatively more productive, than those who work for long hours tirelessly without any rest in between.</p>
